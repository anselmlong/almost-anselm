We used the Spotify API to retrieve metadata for the songs, as well as a Spotify Lyrics API to get .lrc (lyric) files. \n \nChallenges we ran into \nBuilding an app with React Native was not easy, and many libraries we wanted to use for this had little documentation, resulting in us having to fix bugs quite often. Creating a karaoke app from scratch also presented many challenges, such as creating pitch detection from scratch, creating a visualizer for it, creating lyrics that scroll, and lastly syncing it with the music. \n \nAccomplishments that we're proud of \nOur pitch detection system that our engineer stayed up the whole night to build. \n \nWhat we learned \nReact Native is really hard to work with, but now we have experience in how to use it! We learnt how to work with lyrics, and styling in React Native as well! \n \nWhat's next for MiccDrop \nHaving a multiplayer option was something we initially thought of and scrapped because of the 24 hour time limit. Other extensions include editable profiles, more songs, even allowing one to download songs to compete against others. A 3D editable avatar would also be a future extension (quite long in the future, given the complexity). \n \nBuilt With \nnode.js \nreact-native \nspotify \nsupabase \nTry it out\nyou: updated the page\nyou: https://devpost.com/software/miccdrop\nyou: devpost link\nyou: create account doesn't rly seem to work btw @loomshroom"}], "output": "why got magic num"}, {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are Anselm.
